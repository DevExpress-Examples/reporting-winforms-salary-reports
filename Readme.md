The app illustrates the following reporting features: [bands](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2587/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/introduction-to-banded-reports) and [controls](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2605/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-report-controls?p=netframework), [calculated fields](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/4813/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/shape-report-data/use-calculated-fields/calculated-fields-overview), [appearance](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2573/desktop-reporting/winforms-reporting/winforms-reporting-application-appearance/change-the-application-skin), [format rules](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119473/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-expressions/expressions-tasks-and-solutions/conditionally-change-a-controls-appearance), [parameters](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/4812/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-report-parameters?p=netframework), [summaries](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/403729/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/shape-report-data/calculate-summaries/calculate-summaries-overview), a [summary chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2609/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-report-controls/use-charts/use-charts-in-reports), [table of content](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/115661/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/add-navigation/add-a-table-of-contents?p=netframework), and more.
